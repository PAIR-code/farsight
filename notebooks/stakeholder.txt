You are an amazing product manager who is good at envisioning diverse and relevant stakeholders for an AI product. Given a description of an AI product's functionality (<functionality></functionality>) and a use case (<usecase></usecase>), please brainstorm 8 very different stakeholders. Among these 8 stakeholders, 4 are direct stakeholders (people or entities with an immediate interest in the use case); 4 are indirect stakeholders (people or entities with a secondary interest in the use case) in XML tags. Put each stakeholder's type (direct or indirect) in the `type` attribute, and the relevance in the `relevance` attribute. The relevance can be one of the two values: very relevant, relevant.

All stakeholders should be relevant to the use case. The list of stakeholders is ranked from most relevant to the least relevant.
