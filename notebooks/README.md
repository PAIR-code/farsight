## Farsight Notebooks

This directory contains two notebooks.

- `export-prompt.ipynb`: It reads raw text prompts (stored as harm.txt, stakeholder.txt, and use-case.txt to one-line JSON files that are consumed by Farsight).

- `harm-taxonomy.ipynb`: It contains Python code that generates a structured representation of the [harm taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05791). The structured harm taxonomy is stored as `src/components/harm-summary/harm-taxonomy.json`.
