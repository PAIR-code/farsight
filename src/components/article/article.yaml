    Prompt-based interfaces (e.g., <a

    rel='noreferrer'>Google AI Studio</a>, <a
    href='https://platform.openai.com/playground' target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer'>OpenAI Playground</a>, and <a
    href='https://poloclub.github.io/wordflow/' target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer'>Wordflow</a>)  for Large Language Models (LLMs) have made
    prototyping and building AI-powered applications easier than ever before.
    However, identifying potential harms that may arise from AI applications
    remains a challenge, particularly during prompt-based prototyping. To
    address this challenge, we designed and developed Farsight, a novel
    interactive <em>in situ</em> tool that helps people <strong>identify potential harms</strong>
    from the AI applications they are prototyping.

  - >
    Farsight is designed and developed for both AI prototypers (i.e., prompt
    creators) and developers of web-based prompting interfaces. First, AI
    prototypers can use Farsight in various ways: through this demo website, a
    <a href='https://github.com/PAIR-code/farsight' target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer'>Chrome Extension</a> enabling it on Google AI Studio, or
    using a <a href='https://pypi.org/project/farsight/' target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer'>Python package</a> to enable it on Jupyter Notebook.
    Developers of prompting tools can easily integrate our open-source and
    reusable components into their AI prototyping tools.

usageIntro:
  - >
    Farsight includes a collection of <strong><em>in situ</em> widgets</strong>
    that can be integrated into diverse prompting workflows, such as web-based
    prompting GUIs and computational notebooks. To ensure users remain focused
    on their primary task or of writing prompting, Farsight uses progressive
    disclosure to gradually reveal these widgets with increasing complexity and
    engagement: (1) Alert Symbol → (2) Awareness Sidebar → (3) Harm
    Envisioner.

usageAlert:

    The Alert Symbol is an always-on display on top of the AI prototyping tool,
    displaying the alert level of a user's prompt. Every time the user runs
    their prompt, the Alert Symbol updates the alert level using the new prompt.
    Based on the computed alert level, there are three modes, each characterized
    by a progressively more attention-grabbing style. Thus, Farsight only
    disrupts AI prototypers' flow when their prompts require more caution.

  - >
    To categorize the potential harms that might arise from users' prompts,
    Farsight employs a novel technique that uses the <strong>similarity between
    the prompt and previously documented AI incident reports</strong> as a proxy
    for the prompt's alert level. First, we use LLM to extract high-dimensional
    latent representations (embeddings) of all AI incident reports indexed in
    the <a href='https://incidentdatabase.ai/' target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer'>AI Incident Database</a>, which includes more than 3k
    community-curated news reports about AI failures and harms. Then, we extract
    the embedding of the user's prompt and compute pairwise cosine distances
    between the prompt embedding and AI incident report embeddings. We label
    each incident report as <code class="code">irrelevant</code>, <code
    class="code">remotely relevant</code>, and <code class="code">moderately
    relevant</code> based on two distance thresholds 0.69 and 0.75. We determine
    these two thresholds from an experiment with 1k random prompts.

  - >
    Finally, we show the numbers of AI incidents that are classified as <code
    class="code">remotely relevant</code> in an orange circle and <code
    class="code">moderately relevant</code> in a red circle as a proxy of the
    prompt's potential risk. In other words, we consider a prompt to have a
    higher risk <strong>if many AI incident reports are semantically and syntactically
    similar to it.</strong>
