    Prompt-based interfaces (e.g., <a

    prototyping and building AI-powered applications easier than ever before.
    However, identifying potential harms that may arise from AI applications
    remains a challenge, particularly during prompt-based prototyping. To
    address this challenge, we designed and developed Farsight, a novel
    interactive <em>in situ</em> tool that helps people <strong>identify potential harms</strong>
    from the AI applications they are prototyping.

    Farsight is designed and developed for both AI prototypers (i.e., prompt
    creators) and developers of web-based prompting interfaces. First, AI
    prototypers can use Farsight in various ways: through this demo website, a
    <a href='https://github.com/PAIR-code/farsight' target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer'>Chrome Extension</a> enabling it on Google AI Studio, or
    using a <a href='https://pypi.org/project/farsight/' target='_blank'
    rel='noreferrer'>Python package</a> to enable it on Jupyter Notebook.
    Developers of prompting tools can easily integrate our open-source and
    reusable components into their AI prototyping tools.
