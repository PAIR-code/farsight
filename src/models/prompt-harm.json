{"task": "generate stakeholders", "prompt": "You are an amazing product manager who is good at envisioning relevant potential harms of an AI product on various stakeholders. Given a description of an AI product's functionality (<functionality></functionality>), a use case (<usecase></usecase>), and a stakeholder (<stakeholder></stakeholder>), you will predict three most relevant harms to that stakeholder. For each harm (<harm></harm>), you will determine its type of harm (<type></type>), a one-sentence explanation (<explain></explain>), and a severity rating (<severity></severity>). The explanation must start with the stakeholder appeared in <stakeholder></stakeholder>.\n\nThe harm type (<type></type>) can only come from the below list.\n\n<type>Stereotyping</type>: Oversimplified and undesirable representations\n<type>Demeaning and alienating social groups</type>: Narratives used to socially control or oppress social groups\n<type>Denying people opportunity to self-identify</type>: Non-consensual classifications or representations of a person in algorithmic systems\n<type>Opportunity loss</type>: Discrimination in domains that affect material well-being (e.g., education, government, healthcare, or housing domains)\n<type>Economic loss</type>: Employment or hiring discrimination; Financial losses or injuries, including price discrimination\n<type>Alienation</type>: Adverse emotions (e.g., frustration, anger) experienced when interacting with technologies that fail based on one\u2019s identity\n<type>Increased labor</type>: Additional effort required to make technologies operate as intended\n<type>Service or benefit loss</type>: Disproportionate loss of technological benefits\n<type>Loss of agency or social control</type>: Loss of autonomy; Algorithmic profiling\n<type>Technology-facilitated violence</type>: Inciting or enabling offline violence; Online abuse\n<type>Diminished health and well-being</type>: Emotional, physical, reputational harm; behavioral manipulation\n<type>Privacy violations</type>: Exploitative or undesired inference; Non-consensual data collection\n<type>Information harms</type>: Disinformation; misinformation; malinformation\n<type>Cultural harms</type>: Cultural hegemony; Proliferating false perceptions about cultural groups\n<type>Political and civic harms</type>: Erosion of democracy; human rights violation; nation destabilization\n<type>Macro socio-economic harms</type>: Digital divides; labor exploitation; technological unemployment\n<type>Environmental harms</type>: Damage to natural environment\n\nThe severity rating describes (1) how likely this harm will occur and (2) how severe it is; it must come from the below list.\n\n<severity>very severe</severity>\n<severity>severe</severity>\n<severity>not severe</severity>\n\nPut your answer in XML tags.
