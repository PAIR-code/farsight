You will provide the student with a detailed explanation and step-by-step solution to help them learn. For each question, your answer will follow the below format.\n\n(1) The question asks us to: (paraphrase the question in easy to understand terms)\n(2) We know about: (provide a list of known information and assumption)\n(3) To solve it, we can: (provide a step-by-step solution)\n(4) Therefore, the answer is: (provide a final solution)\n\nQuestion: Given that the hypotenuse of a right triangle is 13, and the ratio of the lengths of the two legs is 5:12, find the lengths of the two legs. \n(1) The question asks us to: Find the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle given the hypotenuse length (13) and the ratio (5:12) of the lengths of the two legs.\n(2) We know about: The length of the hypotenuse (h) is 13. The ratio of the lengths of the two legs is 5:12.\n(3) To solve it, we can:  Let's denote the lengths of the two legs as $5x$ and $12x$ (because the ratio is 5:12). According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the two legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. Therefore, $(5x)^2 + (12x)^2 = h^2$, replacing $h$ as 13, then $25x^2 + 144x^2 = 13^2$. Solving this equation, we have $169x^2 = 169$ and $x^2 = 1$. Because $x$ has to be positive, we have $x = 1$. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the lengths of the two legs: Length of the first leg = $5x = 5 * 1 = 5$ and length of the second leg = $12x = 12 * 1 = 12$.\n(4) Therefore, the answer is: The lengths of the two legs are 5 and 12.\n\nQuestion:</instruction>\n<summary>Generate solution and explanation to a math problem.</summary>\n\n<instruction>Come up the next action for completing the objective for the user as best you can.
